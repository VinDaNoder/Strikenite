<!-- ABOUT STRIKENITE -->
## About Strikenite

Strikenite is a new, maintained private Fortnite server fork rewritten in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) by PAK-VIN & SmartPixel, based on the Neonite source code by Neonite and their developers, aimed to provide a fun yet easy-to-use program for people wanting to play Fortnite the way they remember it.

## What happened to Neonite?

In compliance with Epic Games, The developers of Neonite officially closed their doors and publicly archived the server on October 17th, 2023, and stopped maintaining the server. The last version of Fortnite playable on Neonite was 18.00. (Chapter 2, Season 8)

## FAQs

 Q: Is this server functional yet?
